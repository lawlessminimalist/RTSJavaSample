# Python Video Publisher 
As apart of the RTMP/RTS project, this python script will run on a low powered device (RPI 3b+) and link to a PI Camera and stream the video over RTMP to the server written in Java.
The goal here is to learn as much about RTMP/Video Streaming from a technical stand-point via actually building an e2e streaming system. This server will initially be built in python for simplicities sake, but will later be converted to Java in order to further expand on my Java skills and writting efficient code that could run on a variety of computer specs.
